Homebrew coders everywhere will be pleased to know that Art has released the source code for his Pi Calc application. For those who don't remember it, Pi Calc v1 was an application that counted Pi up to 30,000 digits.<br><br>As to why he released the source for the application, Art writes, "Someone has requested the source, and I'm finished with it, so here it is. I've never released PSP source to anyone without releasing to the entire public. The pi algo is by an unknown author, but was released to public domain."<br><br>In any event, it should be an interesting development if someone was able to integrate Art's homebrew into their own homebrew calculators for the PSP.
